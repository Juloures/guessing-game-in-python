# Number Guessing Game in Python

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program indicates whether the guess was too high or too low. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number, and the program displays the number of attempts it took.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Feedback for each guess: "Too high!" or "Too low!".
- Displays the number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.
